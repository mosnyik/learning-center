# LEARNING CENTER
As time goes, people have more information to consume which leaves them with less time for other equally important things. Learning can take a chunck of our time hence the evolution of self learning with the advent of internet. With even more progress in the development of technology, we can have a proof that we completed our study anytime we complete it with a publicly verifiable CERTIFICATE minted in our name.
Learning center is a project that allows for learners to complete learning tasks and get their certificates minted to their wallets which can be verified anytime by anyone.

The minted certificate would have:
- the issuer's identity
- the bearer's name
- the certificate id
- date of completion
- the course completed

TECH STACK USED
The project has a frontend, a backend and smart contract.
The frontend is built with html, css and js
the backend is built using Zoho Suites and solidity for smart contracts is used for the minting of the Soulbond Certificate NFT.

HOW IT WORKS
The user need to create an account with their email, once logged in, they can access the courses specific to them and read through.
The courses can have 

* reading materials, video explainers and other referenced materials or talks from experts,
* exercise questions or quiz between key concepts in the course module
* Progressive bar to show there score in the exercise or quiz
* it is required that a user gets 100% before they are marked as success in a module

Once the user completes the tasks or the quizes and get the perfect score of 100%, they can graduate which allows them to mint their graduation NFT.

The project is built as a product for learning institutions to cutomize to their needs.
